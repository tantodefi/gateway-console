# ---- Yield Deposits (Aave V3) ----
# The yield deposit feature works with XMTP_NETWORK=dev.
# By default, harvested yields are deposited to the connected user's payer balance.
# No additional configuration is required for the default "user pays" mode.
#
# To enable "App pays" mode (where yields fund messaging for all users):
# 1. Set VITE_GATEWAY_PAYER_ADDRESS to your app's payer wallet address
# 2. In the harvest dialog, select "App Gateway" as the deposit destination
#
# Note: In dev mode, messages don't consume from the payer balance (direct to XMTP network),
# but the on-chain deposit flow works for testing.

# Optional: Override ETH/USD price for yield calculations (default: $2500)
# VITE_ETH_USD_PRICE=2500

# Generate with: cast wallet new
